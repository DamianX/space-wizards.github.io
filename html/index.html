					<b>Space Station 13</b> has been around for almost 15 years.<br>
					BYOND is terrible and might as well be stuck in the 2000's.<br>
					It's been obvious for a long time that we need a remake.
				</p>

				<p>
					The original remake died.<br>
					Then SS14 lived for a month and effectively died.<br>
					What was once a bustling 100 people IRC channel on Rizon was reduced to 15 people whose
					join and leave messages are the only thing filling space (bus).<br>
					There have been absolutely uncountable attempts. All have failed one way or another.
				</p>

				<p>
					But giving up isn't the solution.<br>
					<i>We're gonna get this game off BYOND. And fix it at the same time.</i>
				</p>

				<p>
					We're gonna fix the clunky controls.
					The laggy UI.
					The lack of a proper Linux client.
					The terrible development experience.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Space Station 14 is alive and kicking again.</b><br>
					Let's finish this.
