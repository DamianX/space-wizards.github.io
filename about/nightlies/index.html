<p>This page will be updated regularly to tell you how to run the automatically updated builds (nightlies). As soon as we push something it&rsquo;s automatically built and can be downloaded after like, 3 minutes (fast huh).</p>

<p>First of all, <a href="https://builds.spacestation14.io/jenkins/job/SS14%20Content/">here are the downloads.</a></p>

<p>SS14 is in active development so yada yada won&rsquo;t be stable we&rsquo;re not responsible if your computer and/or sanity blows up.
It probably won&rsquo;t though. At least not your computer.</p>

<p>Bug reports appreciated!</p>

<h2 id="windows">Windows</h2>

<p>Download both the client and server and unzip it somewhere sane.
For the client you should run <code>SS14.Client.exe</code>, and for the server you should run <code>SS14.Server.exe</code>.
Then hit connect inside the client and it should all work.</p>

<h2 id="linux">Linux</h2>

<p>Download both the client and server and unzip them somewhere sane.
You will need to have <a href="https://www.mono-project.com/">Mono</a> installed on your system. Pretty much any distro runs it though it&rsquo;s pretty easy to install.
For the client you will want to run &ldquo;<code>mono SS14.Client.exe</code>&rdquo; with a terminal, and &ldquo;<code>mono SS14.Server.exe</code>&rdquo; for the server.
Once that is done you can hit connect in the client and it&rsquo;ll all work.</p>

<p>Quick note, the client needs OpenAL and Freetype to be installed on your system. If there are actually people who don&rsquo;t have these installed on their system already the client is probably not gonna start. In which case tell us so we can bundle them.</p>

<h2 id="macos">MacOS</h2>

<p>Download both the client and server and unzip them somewhere sane.
You will need to have <a href="https://www.mono-project.com/">Mono</a> installed on your system.
For the client you can just run the app directly, <em>dismiss the popup telling you the app is not from a verified developer and thus you can&rsquo;t open it because Apple treats you like <del>the</del> sheep <del>you are for buying their products</del>, open security preferences and hit &ldquo;Open Anyways&rdquo;.</em></p>

<p>To run the server just run &ldquo;<code>mono SS14.Server.exe</code>&rdquo; with a terminal.
Once that is done you can hit connect in the client and it&rsquo;ll all work.</p>

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

<p><strong>The code is C#, can&rsquo;t I run the builds cross-platform?</strong></p>

<p>No, while the main code is .NET, the builds will not start cross-platform. Two reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>We decided to use conditional compilation instead of runtime detection for some platform-specific functions.</li>
<li>We are shipping multiple native libraries and it&rsquo;d be a massive waste to package those for each platform into the same download.</li>
</ul>

<p>While we could theoretically solve both of these, we won&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s not worth the hassle.</p>

<p><strong>What about supporting other CPU architectures (x86/i686, ARM, &hellip;)?</strong></p>

<p>Right now we only support x64.</p>

<ul>
<li>x86/i686: Not happening. While we totally <em>could</em> do this, there is no reason to still drag x86 behind us. If you can&rsquo;t run an x64 program in 2018, you ought to get off Windows XP. CPUs that aren&rsquo;t x64 are too slow to run SS14 anyways. (actually this might not be true but it&rsquo;s still not worth supporting) It complicates the build tools for no reason.</li>
<li>ARM/ARM64: Could/probably will happen if somebody codes it, but it&rsquo;s not a priority. Mono does support it.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Is this malware?</strong></p>

<p>No. If you&rsquo;re paranoid you can download the code yourself and build from source though.</p>
