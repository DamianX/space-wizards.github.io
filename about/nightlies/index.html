<p>Through rigorous effort on our part, you too can play SS14 <em>TODAY!</em> This page will list all the details necessary to launching and trying the game.</p>

<h2 id="updates">Updates</h2>

<p>The game is still in constant development. As soon as something is pushed to master it will be automatically built for all platforms and can be downloaded within like 3 minutes.</p>

<p>If you want to follow this process, it&rsquo;s done <a href="https://builds.spacestation14.io/jenkins/job/SS14%20Content/">right here on Jankins</a></p>

<p>SS14 is in active development so yada yada won&rsquo;t be stable we&rsquo;re not responsible if your computer and/or sanity blows up. It probably won&rsquo;t though. At least not your computer.</p>

<p>Bug reports appreciated!</p>

<h2 id="the-launcher">The Launcher</h2>

<p>The easiest way to get SS14 right now is to download the <a href="https://github.com/space-wizards/SS14.Launcher/releases/tag/v0.1.0">Launcher</a> for your platform and run it. It&rsquo;s <code>SS14.Launcher.exe</code> on Windows and <code>SS14.Launcher</code> on Linux (both native binaries you can run directly). macOS is untested and probably broken and you&rsquo;d need to launch it from a terminal too. For <strong>Linux and macOS</strong> you will also need to have <strong><a href="https://www.mono-project.com/">Mono</a> installed</strong> on your system.</p>

<p>The launcher will automatically download and update the main client. From there you can connect to our public server with the convenient button in the main menu.</p>

<h2 id="manually">Manually</h2>

<p>If you want to host a server on your own machine (or are running on macOS, sorry) you will want to download the client and server manually as zip files.</p>

<p>You can get binaries of the client and server for your platform <a href="https://builds.spacestation14.io/jenkins/job/SS14%20Content/">right here</a>. You&rsquo;ll have to extract the files somewhere sane. Actually running it is pretty easy but check the sections down below for your platform.</p>

<h3 id="windows">Windows</h3>

<p>For the client you should run <code>SS14.Client.exe</code>, and for the server you should run <code>SS14.Server.exe</code>.
Then hit &ldquo;Direct Connect&rdquo; inside the client and it should all work.</p>

<h3 id="linux">Linux</h3>

<p>You will need to have <a href="https://www.mono-project.com/">Mono</a> installed on your system. Pretty much any distro runs it though it&rsquo;s pretty easy to install.
For the client you will want to run &ldquo;<code>mono SS14.Client.exe</code>&rdquo; with a terminal, and &ldquo;<code>mono SS14.Server.exe</code>&rdquo; for the server.
Then hit &ldquo;Direct Connect&rdquo; inside the client and it should all work.</p>

<h3 id="macos">MacOS</h3>

<p>Download both the client and server and unzip them somewhere sane.
You will need to have <a href="https://www.mono-project.com/">Mono</a> installed on your system.
For the client you can just run the app directly, <em>dismiss the popup telling you the app is not from a verified developer and thus you can&rsquo;t open it because Apple treats you like <del>the</del> sheep <del>you are for buying their products</del>, open security preferences and hit &ldquo;Open Anyways&rdquo;.</em></p>

<p>To run the server just run &ldquo;<code>mono SS14.Server.exe</code>&rdquo; with a terminal.
rminal, and &ldquo;<code>mono SS14.Server.exe</code>&rdquo; for the server.</p>

<h2 id="system-requirements">System Requirements</h2>

<h3 id="every-platform">Every Platform:</h3>

<ul>
<li>64-bit OS (amd64)</li>
<li>OpenGL 3.3</li>
<li>250 MiB free memory should do it. (Client takes approx 100 MiB right now but that&rsquo;s probably gonna increase)</li>
<li>Gonna need a decent CPU though because the code is poorly optimized right now.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="linux-1">Linux:</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.mono-project.com/">Mono</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Quick note, the client needs OpenAL and Freetype to be installed on your system. If you don&rsquo;t have both of these installed the client is definitely not gonna start, so tell us so we can bundle them!</p>

<h3 id="macos-1">macOS:</h3>

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

<p><strong>The code is C#, can&rsquo;t I run the builds cross-platform?</strong></p>

<p>No, while the main code is .NET, the builds will not start cross-platform. Two reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>We decided to use conditional compilation instead of runtime detection for some platform-specific functions.</li>
<li>We are shipping multiple native libraries and it&rsquo;d be a massive waste to package those for each platform into the same download.</li>
</ul>

<p>While we could theoretically solve both of these, we won&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s not worth the hassle.</p>

<p><strong>What about supporting other CPU architectures (x86/i686, ARM, &hellip;)?</strong></p>

<p>Right now we only support x64.</p>

<ul>
<li>x86/i686: Not happening. While we totally <em>could</em> do this, there is no reason to still drag x86 behind us. If you can&rsquo;t run an x64 program in 2018, you ought to get off Windows XP. CPUs that aren&rsquo;t x64 are too slow to run SS14 anyways. (actually this might not be true but it&rsquo;s still not worth supporting) It complicates the build tools for no reason.</li>
<li>ARM/ARM64: Could/probably will happen if somebody codes it, but it&rsquo;s not a priority. Mono does support it.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Is this malware?</strong></p>

<p>No. If you&rsquo;re paranoid you can download the code yourself and build from source though.</p>
