<h3 id="what-is-space-station-14">What is Space Station 14?</h3>

<p><strong>Space Station 14</strong> (SS14 for short) is a community driven project to get the open source game <a href="https://spacestation13.com/">Space Station 13</a> into a new engine and free from its current engine, <a href="https://secure.byond.com/">BYOND</a>. BYOND is an incredibly dated engine, and is not cutting it. It&rsquo;s a pain to develop for, slow, proprietary, and looks like it&rsquo;s from 2005. <!-- TODO: Verify how accurate this number is. --> Along with this we will try to make the game more enjoyable all around, such as pixel movement and a consistent style.</p>

<p>Originally, the SS14 project was a continuation of <a href="https://forum.ss13.co/">Goonstation</a>&rsquo;s remake attempt, which was abandoned and <a href="https://archive.fo/xey2L">open sourced on 19 of January, 2015</a>. We&rsquo;ll bite the bullet: due to poor project management, SS14 originally died after a month or two. But fear not! <strong>We&rsquo;re back!</strong></p>

<h3 id="status">Status</h3>

<p>Currently, the project is in a &ldquo;pre-alpha&rdquo; state. We have many tasks ahead of us. On this website you will be able to find progress reports as long as we&rsquo;re kicking.</p>

<h3 id="getting-involved">Getting involved</h3>

<p>Rome was not built in a day, and neither was SS14. We can always use extra hands! The entire project is open source and available on GitHub here:</p>
